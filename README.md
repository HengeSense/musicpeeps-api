MusicPeeps API
==============

This is a project to handle the backend logic of how musicpeeps RUNS.  This will work by communicating with the database and forwarding requests to the web-frontend as well as the mobile applications, etc.  It will mostly send and receive input using the json format (supported by the node.js frontend and many other applications).
